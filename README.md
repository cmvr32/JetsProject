## Jets Project

### Week 3 homework for Skill Distillery.

## Overview: Food Truck

For our third homework assignment at Skill Distillery we built an airfield that houses a variety of jets. The program allows the user to add and remove jets. View jet details and fly all the jets.

Assignment Guidelines: 

Create a fleet of jets with different capabilities. The application will be a menu to use your jets and access information about them. All jets must have a model, speed, range, and price associated with them and will have a fly() method that prints out the jet details and the amount of time the jet can fly until it runs out of fuel (based on speed and range).Create two interfaces of your choice for specializations of Jets and at least two implementation classes that extend Jet and implement your interfaces.

## Technologies/Skills Used

I began by building each jet class and then the jet application. I built out the a simplified menu then focused on each element of the menu working out the functionality of each menu option. 

Within the airfield class I pulled in the text file with existing jet information. Converting the informaiton read to the appropriate variables then storing the information in an array list.

I built methods within the airfield class that execute each element in the menu, listing all jets in the airfield, flying all the jets, listing the fastest jet and the one with the longest range, adding and removing jets from the list. 

* Java
* Eclipse
* Git

## Lessons Learned

Similar to the Food Truck project I found this weeks homework incredibly difficult. I found myself knowing what I needed to accomplish, with an idea of how to accomplish it but needing to review class material and work with the TA's for help with executing. 

Personally I deepened my understanding of how data is built and shared between classes as well as the relationship between child and parent classes. 

Technically I learned how to read a text file and then store that data in a way that allows the program to manipulate that data as needed.
